Our customer is looking for a way to get better information about the things they eat. They want a breakdown of what is in the food they are looking to purchase.  They are looking for it be presented in a way they that is easy to understand and that provides them a scoring system on how healthy, or unhealthy, it is. The app we intend to deliver will provide our customers a way to scan barcodes on different foods and then have a set of data returned. We will least the ingredients that the item contains and provide a number (1-10) on what its perceived health benefit is. The scale is 10 being the healthiest and 0 being the least healthy type of ingredient. The app will flag ingredients that could be allergens, sticking with the most common (examples: gluten, soy, eggs). The stakeholders for this app will be people who want to be more health conscience with what they eat, nutritionists, doctors, and people who may want to avoid certain ingredients.
